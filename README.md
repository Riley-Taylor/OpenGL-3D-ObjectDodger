# OpenGL-3D-ObjectDodger


+Project for my Computer Graphics course!
<br> 💠 The car drives down a straight road, while random objects are intialized along the road and the player must avoid the objects.
<br> 💠 If object collision is detected, the game stops and prompts the user to retry. 
<br> 💠 Once the user wins, they can leave the game via button prompt! 
<br> ♦️ I also implemented a sound effect from the hit racing game Fzero X (1998) to play when the user crosses the finish line.
