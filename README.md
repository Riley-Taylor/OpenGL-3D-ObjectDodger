# OpenGL-3D-ObjectDodger

 **### Project for my Computer Graphics course! ###**
### Overview ###
💠 The car drives down a straight road, while random objects are intialized along the road and the player must avoid the objects.
<br> 💠 If object collision is detected, the game stops and prompts the user to retry. 
<br> 💠 Once the user wins, they can leave the game via button prompt! 
<br> ♦️ I also implemented a sound effect from the hit racing game Fzero X (1998) to play when the user crosses the finish line.
<br><br>

### Controls ###
💠 A,D moves the vehicle left and right. <br>
💠 SPACE pauses the game.
#### Features ####
* The objects are generated randomly, and are different on each playthrough.
* The score in the top right increases by 1 for every obstacle passed.
* The application prompts the user to retry if a collision is detected.
* The user can navigate freely between lanes.
* Constraints are set to stop the user from driving off screen/off track.
